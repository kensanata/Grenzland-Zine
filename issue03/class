The Anointed of 
Abyssal Slaughter

Thence came the dread pirate 
.I Stinkebarter , 
who had been making the shipping
lanes in this part of the world unsafe for close to a century. Like ravenous
beasts these monsters threw themselves at their victims. They stank of the sea,
their skins were full of scales, and their beards were mottled with seaweed and
barnacles. They stared lifelessly from big bulging fish eyes as they cut down
anyone in their path and threw their bodies to the sharks. That was the way of
the pirates that had laired in those islands for generations. Some said they
were the cursed of the sea.

In the depths there are things sleeping for untold aeons. Occasionally one of
them reaches up from the darkest reaches and touches the existence of the light
dwellers. They call it the curse of the Sea God, the Bane of the Depths, or the
Aquatic Disease. Most air-breathing sailors are unaware  the aquatic races are
afflicted with it as well. It is rare, but on the surface it affects mostly
fishermen and pirates, seldom others. It causes them to change. The first sign
is lethargy except when in water. They start growing gills, their skin hardens,
and their fingers elongate. And with times they start looking more and more...
fishy. Soon they only can be roused by aggression, often fighting in wild
frenzies, biting and gurgling inhuman chants. As of today nobody knows how to
cure this condition. No cleric has succeeded in removing this curse, no
physician seems competent to cure this malady. Some people will live with it
until the end of their unnaturally long life, but many will perish before, or
just go into the water, never to reappear.
.PP
There is a reason for this condition and for it's incurability: that is, it's
not a disease, and it's not a curse. It is a blessing. Even more, it’s victim
are anointed into a holy office. A blessing though by an eldritch aquatic deity
that no human knows, and which even the aquatic people might only whisper about
in half-forgotten stories. The god of abyssal slaughter (the actual name is
forgotten and was unpronounceable anyway) was first venerated by a
now-forgotten race of Coelacanthi-men, and it was a god of blood, murder, and
combat. None of their old temples remain even under the sea, but in some of the
places they once stood, at the right time, with the right sacrifices (we are of
course talking about blood and gore), the deity will bestow their greatest gift
on those that bring them: the gift of their form. No-one is aware of this fact,
as it is mostly pirates and raiders that just happen to massacre enough victims
in exactly the right spot that are bestowed this honor, with the occasional
whaler or fisherman caught in between. Most of them see it as a curse by the
gods of the sea. And of course they are only half-wrong.
.PP
.B Mechanically: 
if intelligent beings are killed and given to the sea in one of
the holy places of the Coelacanth god, they are counted as sacrifices. The ways
of the god are unknownable, but in general about 1000 unintelligent beings, 100
intelligent ones, or 10 Anointed of the Coelacanth god will be enough to grant
the Blessing of Form. It does not matter if they are killed in the water or
outside, as long as their fresh blood and meat ends as a feast for the ocean
dwellers. 
.H2
The Anointed NPC class
.PP
Those anointed and given the blessing take the Anointed class instead of their
original class. They keep their hit dice, saving throws, and attack bonus, and
all other class features, until the Anointed class gives them a better value.
.PP
XP for Anointed can only be gained for killing and/or technically also for
performing quests. Quests will come by the blubbering of the god in the
character’s dreams and consist mostly of acts of carnage. (like a Quest spell). 
.PP
The status can not be cured by Cure Disease spells or Remove curse spells (as
it is neither), but performing actions that are anathema to the Coelocanth god
might revoke the Anointed status. The mind of the deep god is difficult to
measure though, so nobody is quite sure what is anathema or not. Selling your
soul to a demon or other being is a surefire way though, so there's that.  The
blessing of form also grants the character an unnaturally long life-span,
however useful that is. Most afflicted disappear after a few years, some hold
on for a few hundred years, but ultimately most disappear into the waves.
(mechanically their lifespan increases to 
.I "natural lifespan" 
\[mu] 
.I "level of Anointed" ).

cannot enter dry land anymore (100 paces past the shore)
.IP "Level 4:"
needs to spend half of time breathing water
.IP "Level 8:"
cannot breathe air anymore, unavoidable urge to travel to Coelacanth god

.PP
Every level past the first a character has to make a saving roll against
Spells or be drawn to the next holy site of the Coelacanth god. If not yet
they will become an NPC and spend the rest of their time in the vicinity
"guarding" the non-existent site. Most of the rare Anointed are just living
there as hermits, only going out for hunting, some of the larger sites have
small villages or the equivalent to monasteries of these blood-thirsty
hermits, others might be more enterprising \[em] raiding the surrounding
settlements and trade routes as pirates.
.PP
At level 8 they are drawn to the depths where the Coelacanth god dwells. This
is an ancient, near-ruined city of the elder adherents of the god, and there
they are matched against other Anointed ones until they either die a
sacrifice, or gain the right to challenge the god himself. What happens if
they kill the god is not quite clear. It might be this already has happened.

Note: I recently have come to reevaluate NPC classes as a useful concept. My
main idea is to see them as the equivalent for specific monsters, but in
social settings. The idea of the Anointed is similar to the presentation of
Werewolf and Vampire classes in various places (e.g. Imagine magazine #28),
but in this case trying to emulate the picture of damned sailors cursed to
sail the seas, crossed with some good old Lovecraftian transformation into
fish people.
