Jailed!
.PP
This is a pirate themed escape dungeon. The player characters wake up,
each in an individual cell just with normal clothes one. Obviously they
have been captured by pirates and are held prisoners. It's designed for
four player characters. The GM should assign, which character starts in 
which prison cell. If there are more than four characters, double
occupancy would be an option. It was originally written with classic D&D
in mind, but then play tested with GURPS 3rd Edition. I reproduce it 
here system agnostic. It's all not that complicated.

The Prison Cells
.IP 1
A dark and dank prison cell. Nothing special here, no loose stones 
or anything.
The door is made from wood and has a small barred opening, through which 
the player character who's incarcerated here can 
.B "see the guards and talk to them" .
.IP 2
Another simple jail call. When the guards talk, they can still be 
overheard clearly from here. In the dirt under the simple wooden
bed a 
.B "rusty dagger"
can be found.
.IP 3
This cell seems to be just the same as the first, however when the 
character closely examines the door they find that the upper hinge is 
quite loose. This 
.B "door could be broken open"
with some moderate force.
.IP 4
This is the darkest cell. In northeastern corner of the wall are some
conspicuously loose stones. Careful removal of the stones will reveal
a low 
.B "crawlspace that leads to a natural cave system" .
.IP 5
An 
.B "orcish guard" , 
armed with an axe and clad in chainmail always sits 
here to have an eye on the prisoners. Though 30% of the time he 
is asleep and snores loudly.
.IP 6
Quarter of the orcish guards. There's some roughly made wooden 
furniture, two beds, some stale, greasy 
.B provisions , 
rope, some 
.B torches , 
flint and steel. 30% of the time a second orcish 
guard sleeps here. He's got a rusty sabre, and leather armor.
.H2
The Hallway
.IP *
Everytime the character arrive at the marked part of the hallway 
roll the encounter die: 1 in 6, the characters hear 
noises from somewhere up the stairs: a
door opening and closing, and then footsteps. Moments later
.B "1d3 Pirates"
and one orcisch guard come down the corridor.
.IP 7
.B "The Treasure Room" 
Here's where the pirates keep their treasure. In any case, there's 
more than the PCs could possibly carry. Look at 
.B "treasure type E" 
for ideas. Notably there are 
.B "two swords and two shields"
in the hoard.
Each of which have a 10% chance of being magical.
.IP
In front of the door there are some conspicuous holes in the walls 
hinting quite obviously at a 
.B "spear trap" .
.H2
The Pirates Hideout
.IP 8
.B "Empty Attic"
This room is empty, both doors open according to the usual rules.
.IP 9
.B "Pirates Bedroom"
Here is where the pirates sleep. 30% of the time a drowsy pirate sleeps
here. There are some woolen blankets and two usable rucksacks here.
.IP 10 
.B "The Mess"
This is the main room of the pirate hideout. The building is stands at
top of a small beach, partly build into the cliffs. There's jungle all
around the beach. 
.IP 
There are always two pirates present plus the cook. On the walls there
are various and sundry sabres, spears and three crossbows.
.IP 
The simple landing pier is where the pirate ship will be docked 20% of 
the time. There are 10 Pirates aboard. If the ship is here, it will 
leave in 6 hours and return in two days.
.IP 11
.B "Storage Room"
here are various pieces of wood, large coils of rope and a few boxes with 
iron spikes and nails.

.IP 12
.B "Pool Slide"
.B1
The crawlway from the fourth prison cell leads to a natural tunnel that
slopes downward for about 70 feet in a southerly direction. The floor is
very slippery. At the end of the slope is a large irregular shaped water 
filled cave, about 40 x 50 feet large. Characters who fall and slip down
the slope plunge into the water which is cold and salty. Some 3 to 6 feet 
above the water surface is a domed cave ceiling. There are two exits
