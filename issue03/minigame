These rules for sailed movement on gaming tables are inspired by the
1968 3M Game 
.I Regatta . 
Numbers are adjusted to work well with the
original fantasy role-playing games of the 1970's: speed is always given
in tabletop inches (").

Initial Wind strength and direction

On a playing surface without a grid, or a square grid, use 8 points of
wind directions:

1	North	5	South

on a hexagonal grid, use 6 points of wind directions:

Movement
.PP
Various ship types have different 
.I "Speed Factors"
depending on their bearing toward the wind.
Each ships speed in tabletop inches (Mv) is then derived by multiplying 
Wind Speed (WS) and Speed Factor (SF):

Mv = WS \[mu] SF

At Wind Speed 0 or 1 (no wind or light breeze) Galleys and Longships may furl sails
and start rowing instead of sailing. Use Speed Factor for Quarter
Reaching as Movement Speed. It takes one round to furl sails and start
rowing. In the next round the rowing vessel may make half speed.
It takes two rounds to come to a full stop again.

At Wind Speed 2 a quarter reaching small galley would sail at speed 14''
per round.
.PP
At that same wind speed a viking long ship would be at an advantage and
make 18'' per round.
.PP
At Wind Speed 3 a proud Galleon would have a hard time beating with no
more then 12'', while the fore-n-aft rigged Schooner would race to
windward making 24''.

One player or the referee rolls a d6 to determine wind speed and
possible change in wind direction (see Wind Roll below).

Each side 
.I may 
roll a luck die (see Luck Roll below)
.IP 3. 3
Each vessel that has marked Strain

possibly changing direction by one point.

Both sides move the second half of their move in reverse initiative
order, possibly changing direction by 1 point. Any ship that does a
second change of direction must mark 1 Strain!

.H3 "Maneuvers"
Optionally, at the end of each game turn ships may declare a maneuver:
.DF "Reef:" 
reduce speed by half. It takes another turn to unreef the sails.
.DF "Furl:" 
drop sails, the vessel is now adrift, down wind at Wind Speed.
It takes two game turns to set sails again.
.DF "Anchor:" 
the ship drops it's anchor, and will stop drifting. Only ships
with furled sails can anchor, lest they have to do an immediate Strain
Roll. It takes two game turns to thus come to a full stop, and three
game turns to light the anchor and set sail again.

6 & Wind Speed +2, mark 1 Strain
.TE
.PP
.KE
Wind Changes due to Luck Rolls usually only apply to the ship the die
was rolled for. However Luck Rolls may change things for everyone, if
two or more sides roll the same result:
.BU
Two or more rolls of a 1: ``Sails luff ...'' cause the wind to
reduce by 1 for 
.I everyone .
.BU
Two or more rolls of a 6: ``Wind Speed +2 ...'' increases the
overall windspeed by 1 for 
.I everyone 
(thus, those who rolled a
six still have the advantage of Wind Speed +1 compared to those who
didn't roll a 6).
.PP
By way of a cumulation of luck rolls, wind speeds of 0 = Calm, or 4+ =
Storm are possible. In case no other rules are provided for these
situations use these:
.DF Calm
no sailing is possible, ships drift. Oared movement, or
some other kind of propulsion may be possible.
.DF Gale 
Wind Speed of four or more (4+) makes sailing difficult
and dangerous. With sails furled or masts broken, ships drift downwind
at Wind Speed. Ships with their sails still up may sail downwind at Wind
Speed plus (!) Speed Factor for Running, but have to mark 1 Strain
every round.
.H3 "The Strain Roll"
The forces of wind and waves are taxing on ships and crew. It's
dangerous to overstrain. Any ships that have marked Strain, have to roll
a d6 every turn and add their current Strain to the roll:
.TS
center,tab(&);
cbcb
cl.
d6 + Strain & Effect
5- & no effect ... not yet!
6 & spars and stays creak: mark 1 extra strain
7 & ship makes water: reduce all speed by 3'' ongoing
8 & stays snap, mark 1 extra strain
9 & deck's awash, reduce active crew by 10\%
10 & sails tear, reduce all speed by 3'' ongoing
11 & a mast breaks, reduce all speed by 3'' or drift
12+ & it's over, ship's sinking in 1d6 turns
.TE
.ta 12.8cR
.PP
With an effective Strain Roll of 12 it depends on whether it's a one
masted ship or not. Naturally one masted ships without a mast can only
drift. A ship with more masts may still sail downwind at reduced speed.
Whenever the resultant speed reaches 0 or less, the ship can only drift
downwind at Wind Speed.	\[em] \fIlkh\fR
